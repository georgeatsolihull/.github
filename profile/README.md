# George's College Work
Welcome! Here you will find all the coursework and programming projects I completed whilst studying for my IT General Level 3 Extended Diploma, specialising in Networking and Cyber Security.

This contains all of my first year work, with the second year work being added once I graduate.

Currently my work is graded at `D*D*D*`.

❤️✨
